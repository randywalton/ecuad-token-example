<h2 id="thisrepoisshowinganexampledesigntokensandtheconnectiontouxanddevelopment">This repo is showing an example Design Tokens and the connection to UX and Development</h2>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>This repo is an example for students to show how a program like Figma can set up Design Tokens a developer can use as they build an App / Website. This also illustrates how Design Tokens work, e.g. like a &#8216;bridge&#8217;, between the UI layout and the coded layout. The example is based on an in-class walkthrough in which basic global tokens were built for a simple card along with simple semantic tokens, e.g. a light and dark theme.</p>

<p>Using the Figma build file (with the Figma Tokens Plugin) you can update the tokens and push to this repo, updating the design of the card(s). Vice versa, you can update the tokens.json file directly (e.g. the developer) and then pull the changes into Figma, updating that files tokens and design.</p>
